# Code Quiz 

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and score

## Description

Once the Code Quiz page is open, simply click on the "Start Quiz" button and answer the following questions. Each correct answer will score you 10 points.  Each incorrect answer will deduct 10 points as well as 10 seconds from the timer.  You have 75 seconds to complete this quiz.  Once you are complete, enter your initials and see how they stack up to the highscores. Go forth and "Be AWESOME!"

The goal was to create a code quiz with questions about basic JavaScript. This was the most challenging assignment to date. There were concepts used that still are not fully understood. 

Probably the biggest takeaway from this assignment was the naming of classes, id's, and variables.  I saw a lot of bugs towards the end because I was getting my variables names confused.  I need to label different and better for best practice in the future.
